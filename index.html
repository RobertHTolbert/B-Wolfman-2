<h2>B. Wolfman's Mansion.</h2>
    <p>Catch up to the policemen to kill them!  They can't fight back yet, but you can only attack them from the rear.  When standing on a red zone, press the direction you want to go to travel between floors.</p>

<p>High Concept: B. Wolfman, the ferocious werewolf, has been cornered by the police in his ancient mansion. Creep through the attic and basement to avoid being seen, and ambush them one by one in classic monster style.</p>
<p>Genre: This is a stealth/platformer game, with emphasis on stealth. Possible expansions will enhance the platforming aspect.</p>
<p>Game Play: Players move B. Wolfman through his mansion in two forms of travel, creeping and running. Running is faster than creeping, but risks alerting nearby policemen. Once behind a policeman players attack and eat him. Once all of the police in one room have been killed and their bodies disposed of, the game will advance to the next ‘room’, or level. After completing all of the rooms B. Wolfman escapes into the night, and the player has won.</p>
<p>Features: The trapdoor stealth system allows the players to switch between three different areas: basement, room, and attic, in order to ambush intruders. Traversing between these areas occurs only at trapdoors in the floor or ceiling. If a policeman sees you, he shoots you and you are dead.</p>
<p>Setting: B. Wolfman is a werewolf, a human that has been transformed into a wolf-man hybrid by evil magic. He lives in a large, run-down mansion at the edge of town, with a basement and attic. His curse compels him to attack anyone he sees, so the police have sent their special anti-werewolf unit to kill him with silver bullets.</p>
<p>Story: B. Wolfman is a people-eating monster, and his past has finally caught up to him! He must use the secret passages hidden in his decrepit mansion to escape the police and avoid being shot.</p>
<p>Target Audience: This game is intended to appeal to college students and other people mature enough to not be offended by violence and werewolves. </p>
<p>Hardware Platforms: Computers that can run Phazer, and have a keyboard.</p>
<p>Estimated Schedule: This game is expected to take five weeks to complete, because of the demands of modeling police behavior. Simplifying the behavior or B. Wolfman’s movement down to one movement type should reduce this time. </p>
<p>Competitive Analysis: There is a wide open market for stealth games where players control a killer werewolf.</p>
<p>Team: I can create all of the sprites and graphic resources, but require teammates who can hold to informal deadlines in group projects, communicate written and orally with confidence, and have good personal hygiene. I have designed this game to be completed by myself, and therefore I lack none of the required skills. </p>
<p>Summary: B. Wolfman has what the world wants after so many bad horror movies and vampire remakes -a monster that eats people. I can bring that vision into reality, adding stealth elements to make the game difficult enough to play again and again. </p>
